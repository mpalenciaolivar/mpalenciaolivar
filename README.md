<h2>üëã Hi there, welcome! </h2>
<p align="left">

I'm a computer scientist and statistician. I have been designing and building decision-making systems for years. I have helped leading companies and not-for-profit institutions with smart algorithms that align with business goals. I have settled on a journey to help companies, and not-for-profit institutions have a 360¬∞ vision of their business every day of the year. I design and apply statistical and computational methods to business challenges and share my knowledge and experience.

* What I do
- Consultancies: I tailor solutions to take on business challenges and deliver a step-by-step plan to help companies thrive.
- Coaching: I help people start with computational science and follow them on their path to mastery.
- Training sessions: coming soon!

üí° Most of my contributions are located on my [company's GitHub repositories](https://github.com/orgs/cognitive-works-consulting/repositories), and my main public projects are pinned on my profile.

In the last decade, I've tested multiple decision-making and knowledge extraction approaches, from statistical modeling and machine learning to fuzzy logic-based models; here is a sample.

* *Currently*, I'm working on:
  * **Clustering** ML approaches for unsupervised data grouping. I am particularly interested in model-based approaches and time series.
  * **Time-series causality** ML approaches for policy impact evaluation.
  * **Uncertainty quantification** Identifying a model's shortcomings.

Parts of my past work on industrial, unsupervised topic extraction from text streams have been published in industrial conferences. I have created three neural-based topic models and applied them to noisy data from industrial data scraping feeds. I have also developed a (proprietary) Python framework to simplify the use and extension of existing models (mine included), thus bridging the gap between model development and Agile software development. [The business case, theoretical foundations, paper references, and framework blueprint are available in my dissertation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11775).

* *Former* research interests:
  * **Hyperbox-based ML** Highly scalable algorithms with online adaptation capabilities to dynamically changing environments and streaming data.
  * **Stochastic variational inference** Scalable optimization algorithms.
