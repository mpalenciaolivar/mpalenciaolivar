<h2>👋 Hi there, welcome! </h2>
<p align="left">

I'm a computer scientist and statistician. I love to learn, research, and code. My passion is to design decision-making systems.

I've had different roles in my career, such as Data Scientist, Software Engineer, and MLOps/DevOps. However, the most important thing I've learned in this time has been the value of:

* 🏅 Highly cooperative environments.
* 🎯 Peer review.
* 💪🏻 Co-specialization.
* 🧪 Empirical falsification.
* 🧑‍🏫 Teaching and sharing knowledge.

In the last decade, I've tested multiple approaches to decision-making, from statistical modeling and machine learning to fuzzy logic-based models; here is a sample.

* *Currently*, I'm working on:
  * **Model-based unsupervised learning** ML approaches for similarity detection.  
  * **Time-series causality** Statistical and ML approaches for policy impact evaluation.
  * **Conformal prediction** Model-agnostic uncertainty quantification.
  * **Hyperbox-based ML** Highly scalable algorithms that come with online adaptation to dynamically changing environments and streaming data.
