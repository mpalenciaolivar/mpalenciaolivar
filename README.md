<h2>👋 Hi there, welcome! </h2>
<p align="left">

I'm a computer scientist and statistician. I love to learn, research, and code. My passion is to design decision-making systems.

I've had different roles in my career, such as Data Scientist, Software Engineer, and MLOps/DevOps. My main professional experiences lie in the financial and automotive industries, where my primary focus was statistical modeling, scoring, forecasting, and predictive analytics.

The most important things I've learned so far have been the value of:

* 🏅 Highly cooperative environments.
* 🎯 Peer review.
* 💪🏻 Co-specialization.
* 🧪 Empirical falsification.
* 🧑‍🏫 Teaching and sharing knowledge.

In the last decade, I've tested multiple decision-making and knowledge extraction approaches, from statistical modeling and machine learning to fuzzy logic-based models; here is a sample.

* *Currently*, I'm working on:
  * **Model-based unsupervised learning** ML approaches for similarity detection.  
  * **Time-series causality** Statistical and ML approaches for policy impact evaluation.
  * **Conformal prediction** Model-agnostic uncertainty quantification.
  * **Hyperbox-based ML** Highly scalable algorithms with online adaptation capabilities to dynamically changing environments and streaming data.

Parts of my past work on industrial, unsupervised topic extraction from text streams have been published in industrial conferences. I have created three neural-based topic models and applied them to noisy data from industrial data scraping feeds. I have also developed a (proprietary) Python framework to simplify using and extend my models, thus bridging the gap between model development and Agile software development. [The business case, theoretical foundations, paper references, and framework blueprint are available in my dissertation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11775).
