<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Miguel!</h1>
<h3 align="center">Quantitative services, IT, and project management</h3>

💬 For years, I have designed and built decision-making systems. I have helped leading companies with intelligent algorithms that align with business goals and compliance standards. I design and apply statistical and computational methods to business challenges and share my knowledge and experience.

<h2>👨‍💻 Projects </h2>

I've worked on and with multiple decision-making and knowledge extraction approaches, from statistical modeling and machine learning to fuzzy logic-based models. I am also into Operations Research and Multi-Agent Systems.

Since completing my Ph.D., I am also a member of the [ERIC Lab](https://eric.msh-lse.fr/) at the University of Lyon, where I occasionally teach and research. My research interests include:
  * **Clustering** ML approaches for unsupervised data grouping. I am particularly interested in model-based approaches and spectral clustering.
  * **Uncertainty quantification** Identifying a model's shortcomings.
