<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Miguel!</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am Data Scientist specialized in Financial Services</h3>

💬 For years, I have designed and built decision-making systems in the financial industry. I have helped leading companies with intelligent algorithms that align with business goals and compliance standards. I design and apply statistical and computational methods to business challenges and share my knowledge and experience. Ask me about anything **ML, Statistics, Operations Research, and Scientific Computing**.

📝 I regularly write articles on [https://www.cognitive-works.com/blog](https://www.cognitive-works.com/blog)

<h2> 🏢 Services I provide </h2>

  * Consultancies: I tailor solutions to take on business challenges and deliver a step-by-step plan to help companies thrive.
  * Coaching: I help people start with computational science and follow them on their path to mastery.
  * Training sessions: coming soon!

You can find more about my services on my [company's website](https://www.cognitive-works.com).

💡 Most of my contributions are on my [company's GitHub page](https://github.com/orgs/cognitive-works-consulting/repositories).

I've worked on and with multiple decision-making and knowledge extraction approaches, from statistical modeling and machine learning to fuzzy logic-based models.

For now:
 - 🔭 I’m working on [Sklex](https://github.com/cognitive-works-consulting/Sklex), a Scikit-Learn extension that provides new models and preprocessing techniques.
 - 🌱 I’m learning [Taipy](https://www.taipy.io/), a data applications-oriented framework for Python.
 - 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on [Awesome Decision Science](https://github.com/cognitive-works-consulting/Awesome-Decision-Science), a professionally curated repository 

Since completing my Ph.D., I am also a member of the [ERIC Lab](https://eric.msh-lse.fr/) at the University of Lyon, where I occasionally teach and research. My research interests include:
  * **Clustering** ML approaches for unsupervised data grouping. I am particularly interested in model-based approaches and spectral clustering.
  * **Uncertainty quantification** Identifying a model's shortcomings.
