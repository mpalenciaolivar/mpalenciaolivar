<h2>üëã Hi there, welcome! </h2>
<p align="left">

I'm a computer scientist and statistician. I have been designing and building decision-making systems for years. I have helped leading companies and not-for-profit institutions with smart algorithms that align with business goals. I have settled on a journey to help companies, and not-for-profit institutions have a 360¬∞ vision of their business every day of the year. I design and apply statistical and computational methods to business challenges and share my knowledge and experience.

What I do:
  * Consultancies: I tailor solutions to take on business challenges and deliver a step-by-step plan to help companies thrive.
  * Coaching: I help people start with computational science and follow them on their path to mastery.
  * Training sessions: coming soon!

You can find more about my services on my [company's website](https://www.cognitive-works.com).

üí° Most of my contributions are located on my [company's GitHub page](https://github.com/orgs/cognitive-works-consulting/repositories).

I've worked on and with multiple decision-making and knowledge extraction approaches, from statistical modeling and machine learning to fuzzy logic-based models.

Here is a sample:
  * **Clustering** ML approaches for unsupervised data grouping. I am particularly interested in model-based approaches and time series.
  * **Time-series causality** ML approaches for policy impact evaluation.
  * **Uncertainty quantification** Identifying a model's shortcomings.
